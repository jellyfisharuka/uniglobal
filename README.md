# Go Project Setup Guide

## Prerequisites
Before running the project, make sure you have the following installed:
- [Go](https://go.dev/dl/) (1.20+ recommended)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) (if required by the project)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (optional for containerized deployment)

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository
```sh
git clone <repository_url>
cd <project_name>
```

### 2. Request Credentials
Some required configuration files (e.g., `.env`, `config.json`, etc.) are not included in the repository for security reasons.
Please request them from the project developer and place them in the appropriate directory before proceeding.

### 3. Install Dependencies
```sh
go mod tidy
```

### 4. Run Database Migrations (if applicable)
If the project includes database migrations, run:
```sh
go run cmd/migrate/main.go
```

### 5. Build and Run the Project
```sh
go run cmd/main/main.go
```

### 6. Running with Docker (Optional)
If a Docker setup is available, you can build and run the project using:
```sh
docker-compose up --build
```

## Project Structure
```
/project_root
â”‚â”€â”€ cmd/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ main/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ main.go  # Entry point of the application
â”‚â”€â”€ internal/        # Core application logic
â”‚â”€â”€ pkg/            # Reusable packages
â”‚â”€â”€ config/         # Configuration files
â”‚â”€â”€ .env            # Environment variables (not included, request from dev)
```

## Additional Notes
- Ensure that your `.env` or `config.json` file is correctly set up before running the application.
- If you face issues, check the logs or contact the developer.

Happy coding! ðŸš€
